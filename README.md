SVM ML model

## Introduction

Diabetes is a number of diseases that involve problems with the hormone insulin. Normally, the pancreas (an organ behind the stomach) releases insulin to help your body store and use the sugar and fat from the food you eat. Diabetes can occur when the pancreas produces very little or no insulin, or when the body does not respond appropriately to insulin. As yet, there is no cure. People with diabetes need to manage their disease to stay healthy.


## Method

SVM ML Model was utilized for the following reasons :

- Low count of dataset (768)
- Relatively memory efficient
- works well with regression based problems


## Factors considered

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration over 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
- Age: Age (years)
- Outcome: Class variable (0 if non-diabetic, 1 if diabetic)
